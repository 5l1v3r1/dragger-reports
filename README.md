# Dragger Reports
Drag n' Drop reports application for rational Dbs

We noticed that every reports application isn't really designed to let the customer go wild and define his own report..

Dragger Reports provides the customer abillity to build report without understanding Sql, in his own native language!


## How it should look:

Build page, from here you build a brand **_New_** *Report* using *sources* and *columns*.

After that you need to **Hover** the mouse over *Sources* to see the *Column* **Each** source contains.

Then, **_Drag_** your *column* into the *columns box* and the *source* will fill **automatically**.
